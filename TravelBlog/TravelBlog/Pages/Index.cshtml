              Hi. I’m Grzegorz Kowalski.
              <br>Welcome to LAOS!
            </h2>
            <p>Besides being one of my all-time favorite people in the world,
              Jodi is also a damn amazing blogger who writes often about food
              and culture. She devotes a lot of time to food on the road, taking
              mouthwatering photos that make me jealous of her ability to do so.
              A former lawyer, she also writes a series called “Thrillable Hours”
              about other lawyers who gave up being a corporate lackey for life on the road.
